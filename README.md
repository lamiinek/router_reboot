# router_reboot
I was tired of having to go to my router and press the restart button(at least twice a week). Also i was too lazy to go to the router's web interface, type 192.168.1.1, enter username an password, go through the menu and stuff. So I made this simple script that remotely reboot my home router in seconds :)

V2: the script can keep rebooting the router till it can access the internet. Saving me numerous manual reboots.

###works with python 3
